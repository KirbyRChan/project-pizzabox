    - protected open to assemblies in inheritance tree
    - internal open to only the assembly

    - protected internal, privated protected

    - static and const created at application start (created by runtime)

Day 3
    - method overloading deals with signature, method overriding deals with inheritance
    - abstract class has implementation, interface does not
    - class level variables are known as fields
    - encapsulation refers to the idea that only the internal code should handle everything including validation with its own code
    - properties are fields with their own ways of reading and writing
    - class has fields, properties, constructors, destructors
